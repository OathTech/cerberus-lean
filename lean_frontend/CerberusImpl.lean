  Hand-written Lean implementations for Cerberus implementation-defined behaviour.
  Corresponds to: ocaml_frontend/ocaml_implementation.ml (DefaultImpl module).
  No process state: the enum's compatible type is program data (an ambient reader of
  the lem model, see below); every function here is a function of its arguments.

  These functions are referenced by `declare lean target_rep` in implementation.lem
  and work with the Lem-generated types from IntegerType.lean and Ctype.lean.

  ABI: LP64 (x86_64-apple-darwin), matching Cerberus DefaultImpl.

/-! ## The enum's compatible type is PROGRAM DATA (program-data parameters E-A, 2026-09-20;
    `docs/2026-09-20_program-data-parameters-EA-DA-record.md`)

The OCaml keeps DefaultImpl's mutable `registered_enums` (ocaml_implementation.ml:
124-150: `register_enum` decides GCC's rule and pushes, `typeof_enum` looks it up
and fails on an unregistered tag); the Lean side has NO registry and no
effect-erased read any more: the map from enum tag to its compatible integer
type is an ambient READER of the lem model (`declare {lean} reader val
enum_definitions`, implementation.lem) — the desugarer records the decided
type in `A.sigma.enum_definitions`, the elaborator carries it into the Core
file's `enumDefs`, linking merges it, and the entries pass the map wherever
the generated code takes `_lemReader_enum_definitions`. The lem-side layout
vals (`Implementation.sizeof_ity` etc.) are SHARED wrappers that normalise
FIRST through the one reader consumer `Implementation.normalise_integerType`
(its rep `normalise_integerType` below) and then call the type-only reps
below on the normalised type; the hand-written memory model receives the map
through its `reader_consumer` stubs (CerbMem) and resolves an `Enum` exactly
where impl_mem.ml resolves it through the registry. Keys compare by
`symbolEquality` (digest + number, description-insensitive — the
`Symbol.symbol_compare` parity of ocaml_implementation.ml:137,145). -/

/-- The enum map: tag ↦ its compatible integer type (the value of the lem reader
    `Implementation.enum_definitions`; the same information the OCaml registry
    holds, as data). -/
abbrev EnumDefs := Fmap sym integerType

/-- Fail-closed stub backing implementation.lem's `enum_definitions` target-coverage
    rep. The reader mechanism rewrites every applied `enum_definitions ()` site to the
    `_lemReader_enum_definitions` parameter, so this constant is never emitted at an
    applied call site; if it ever runs, that is a reader-lifting defect — fail loudly
    (the CerbTags.tagDefsUnreachable shape; `failwithI`, seam hygiene 2026-09-19). -/
def enumDefinitionsUnreachable (_ : Unit) : EnumDefs :=
  failwithI "CerberusImpl.enumDefinitionsUnreachable: applied enum_definitions () site survived reader lifting"

/-- The named lookup — `Ocaml_implementation.typeof_enum` (ocaml_implementation.ml:
    144-150) over the map instead of the registry: the registered compatible type,
    or the oracle's `failwith` text on an unregistered tag (REACHABLE on a Core-text
    input naming an enum tag no C source declared — the .core path's map is empty, as
    the oracle's registry is there). -/
def lookupEnum (enumDefs : EnumDefs) (tag_sym : sym) : integerType :=
  -- the spine scan with `symbolEquality` (digest + number, description-insensitive) —
  -- the same lookup shape as the tag lookups (CerbTagsWf.lookupEntry) and the
  -- `Symbol.symbol_compare` parity of the OCaml registry (ocaml_implementation.ml:145)
  match (fmapElements enumDefs).find? (fun (k, _) => symbolEquality k tag_sym) with
  | some (_, ity) => ity
  | none => failwithI s!"Ocaml_implementation.typeof_enum: '{show_symbol tag_sym}' was not registered"

/-- Resolve an `Enum` through the map and leave every other type as it is — the
    `match ity with Enum tag_sym -> typeof_enum tag_sym | _ -> ity` step the OCaml
    layout functions perform before their own match (ocaml_implementation.ml:80-85,
    :56-57; impl_mem.ml:2369-2372, :2407-2410). -/
def resolveEnum (enumDefs : EnumDefs) : integerType → integerType
  | .Enum0 tag_sym => lookupEnum enumDefs tag_sym
  | ity => ity

/-- register_enum — the Lean rep of `Implementation.register_enum`: the pure `true`.
    The OCaml rep still writes DefaultImpl's registry (ocaml_implementation.ml:129-142)
    and answers `false` on a duplicate tag; on Lean the compatible type is recorded in
    the sigma by the desugarer instead, and the duplicate case is caught by the
    `Map.member tag_sym st.tag_definitions` check just before this call
    (cabs_to_ail_effect.lem register_tag_definition) — so both engines take the same
    branch and this value is never consulted. -/

    Corresponds to: Common.is_signed_ity in ocaml_implementation.ml:79-107,
    instantiated with ~typeof_enum ~char_is_signed:true as DefaultImpl does
    (ocaml_implementation.ml:257). OCaml first resolves Enum through
    typeof_enum, then matches; on Lean the resolution happens BEFORE this
    function — the lem wrapper `Implementation.is_signed_ity` normalises through
    the reader, CerbMem resolves through `resolveEnum` — so the `Enum` arm here
    is the OCaml's `assert false`: unreachable by construction, a loud leaf. -/

/-! ## Type normalisation — the alias table and `normalise_integerType_`

    DefaultImpl's `type_alias_map` (ocaml_implementation.ml:154-171): the
    three N-families alias through ONE function `n_t_aliases` (8 → Ichar,
    16 → Short, 32 → Int_, 64 → Long, `_ → None`); `Intmax_t`/`Intptr_t` →
    Long; `wchar_t`/`wint_t` → Signed Int_; `size_t` → Unsigned Long;
    `ptrdiff_t` → Signed Long. `Common.normalise_integerType_` (:37-66)
    applies `Option.get` to the N-family lookups (:39-44), so a width
    outside {8, 16, 32, 64} — `__cerbty_int128_t`, builtins.lem:19/53 —
    is an uncaught `Invalid_argument "option is None"` on the oracle,
    mirrored as a fail-stop (zero-discrepancy Z2-I-03, ruling Q4).
    Zero-discrepancy Z2-I-01: the previous `normalise_integerType` had NO
    `Signed/Unsigned (IntN_t | Int_leastN_t | Int_fastN_t | Intmax_t |
    Intptr_t)` aliasing, so ailTypesAux.lem:302-303's `(Signed (IntN_t _),
    _) -> fail ()` arms — "inaccessible because of the normalisation" on
    the oracle — were reachable on Lean through the DIRECT `__cerbty_intN_t`
    spellings (the shared <stdint.h> typedefs int32_t as plain `signed
    int`, so ordinary C never produced IntN_t): pin
    tests/immaculate/nolibc/zd-z2i01-cerbty-int32-uac.c. Z2-I-02: the
    previous `.Ptraddr_t => .Unsigned .Long` arm computed where the

    the match — their arms are `assert false` (:188-193, :195-200) and are
    mirrored as fail-stops (unreachable after a total normalisation). Since
    E-A (2026-09-20) the normalisation here is the ALIAS part only: an Enum is
    resolved before this function (the lem wrapper / CerbMem's resolveEnum),
    so this is a function of the type alone.
