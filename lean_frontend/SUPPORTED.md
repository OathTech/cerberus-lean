# Supported profile and announcement scope

Checked 2026-09-25 against Cerberus `bb487dda7c56981e76d67f53ae16e874cfe5ed61`
and Lem `67ec5de70e02e280bb348a4ba826696b76116732` (the Lem pin has since moved to `2d3a492758cb23dc4e417f2961983d25b36ce130` by functional re-pins (via `77ad4fa` and `4e70bb5`, both merged; the current pin `2d3a492` itself is PROVISIONAL — the head of the unmerged lem-lean branch `arc/pnvi-switches`, not yet on `mdd/lean-backend`), generated OCaml byte-identical at each: [re-pin record](docs/2026-10-04_lem-repin-4e70bb5-record.md), [PNVI S1 record](docs/2026-10-05_pnvi-s1-switch-parameter-record.md)). The exact rerun set and
remaining publication checks are in [the follow-up record](docs/2026-09-25_public-readiness-followup.md).
Earlier baseline inventories at Cerberus `e9f9d049f` and MUST cleanup gates
remain in [the remediation record](docs/2026-09-24_public-readiness-remediation.md)
and [the closure record](docs/2026-09-24_public-readiness-closure.md).
This is the current profile; the dated September 6 profile is history.

[AGENT] The announcement can describe an early executable Lean port of the
sequential Cerberus semantics and a general experimental Lem Lean backend.
It should name the limits below. It should not claim full C support,
universal OCaml equivalence, stable APIs or complete release certification.

[USER 2026-09-24]: “We have recently reached the point where our semantics for Cerberus in Lean were accepted by our upstream customer working on reasoning about Cerberus.” This records reported customer acceptance;
it is not a new independent measurement of a downstream checkout.

| Surface | Present evidence | Limit |
|---|---|---|
| Model and observations | Shared Lem input; fork OCaml versus Lean differential lanes; separately pinned pristine-upstream comparisons. `scripts/LADDER.md` defines the lanes and VALIDATION describes their projections. | Printed observations omit some internal state. Shared source and finite tests do not prove general correspondence or ISO C conformance. A registered failure/skip is not an agreement. |
| Execution totality | `scripts/check_exec_totality.sh` is enforced by `scripts/test_unit.sh`; kernel execution cones contain no partial definitions. | Frontend partiality remains. A total function may return an error, kill or opaque failure value; successful completion is not universal. |
| Axioms and native boundary | `check_theorem_axioms.sh`, `check_sorry_token.sh` and `check_exec_purity.sh` check the actual generated, hand-written and consumed LemLib surfaces and pinned boundaries (LemLib's native seams: the `failwithI`/fuel panic bindings and, since the 2026-09-30 lem re-pin, the TEMPORARY `lemSeqImpl` — VALIDATION §3). | No added axiom declarations does not prove native implementations equal their pure signatures. Source censuses and selected theorem-cone checks have distinct scopes (VALIDATION). |
| Fuel | `check_fuel_forms.sh`: 81 workers, comprising 62 measured (12 under hypotheses), 13 checked zero-case kills, six outside the execution closure, zero pending (derived from the registered forms at the baseline pin). | General successor-case propagation and completion monotonicity are not delivered by Lem (TODO 13). Measured stability is not a proof that the sentinel is never reached. Layout acyclicity remains a theorem hypothesis, not a universally established frontend invariant. |
| Program data | Enum compatible types and tag environments are explicit readers; execution symbol digest is `core_run_state.sym_digest`, passed through the driver entries. | The frontend digest/native MD5 seam remains. Reader seeds do not re-seed already-constructed closures; seed positions follow global reader order. |
| Runtime failures and representation | Failure-site and observation gates register known behavior; native harnesses use `LEAN_ABORT_ON_PANIC=1`. | Unused `let`s are forced at run time by LemLib's `lemSeq` (a temporary native seam, invisible to proofs); a failing expression Lean can still drop or delay elsewhere (lem-lean A3/A5) is not forced. Lem strings use Unicode scalars rather than OCaml bytes; ten Lem parity XFAILs are registered at the pin (two string cases, five ruled OCaml-target numeric deviations, three open discrepancies: A5 twice and A1-R). |
| Domain | Default sequential concrete-memory configuration, recorded LP64/libc assumptions, explicit fuel and address-space parameters. | The concrete memory model carries an opt-in, disabled-by-default access-receipt buffer (SC WP0, 2026-09-25: a passive diagnostic instrument, Tier A row 13 — not SC execution). Concurrency/weak memory is not implemented by this profile: `CerbConcurrency` contains stubs, and excluded CMM operations have unsupported markers. Every filesystem operation, including reading stdin, is refused (`CerbFS`, contract D2); inline assembly (GNU `asm`/`__asm__` statements and declarator asm labels) is refused by both engines where upstream erases it (contract D9, 2026-10-05, `scripts/check_asm_refusal.sh`); function-pointer numbers are named deviation N1; the contract ([CONTRACT.md](CONTRACT.md)) is the full statement and says how deeply each part is tested; debug stubs remain. General CHERI, all C extensions and arbitrary malformed Core are not certified. |
| Semantics switches | Since 2026-10-07 (PNVI arc S4, `docs/2026-10-07_pnvi-s4-lane-record.md`): `--switches=PNVI_ae_udi` is supported and matched against the oracle under the same switch by `scripts/test_pnvi.sh` (Tier A row 14: upstream's 44 PNVI litmus files exhaustive, `tests/minimal` under the switch, the pKVM census drivers; 164 rows, 152 AGREE + 3 AGREE-FIRST + 7 registered refusal rows + 2 both-fail rows). | Every other switch and `--iso` are refused at the CLI. Inside the switch, the upstream arms that crash, print or call themselves wrong are refusals (`R-PNVI-nn`, CONTRACT §3). The pKVM allocator drivers are compared in `--first` only (their exhaustive sets exceed the 4G per-test cap on the oracle). Row 14 needs the separately fetched, GPL-licensed pKVM case study (`deps/CN-pKVM-buddy-allocator-case-study` or `PKVM_CASE_STUDY`) and fails closed without it, so a fresh clone cannot pass full Tier A until that repository is provisioned (`scripts/LADDER.md` row 14). |

There is no enforced broad C fragment for which every failure, byte,
layout and native-boundary precondition is proved. Consumers must state
entry-specific hypotheses and use the current definitions, not infer a
universal theorem from a green differential baseline.

The minimal baseline contains 113 rows: 90 MATCH, 18 UB_MATCH and five
CERB_SKIP (derived from `scripts/exec_baseline.txt`, 2026-09-24 at the
baseline pin). The pristine register has seven `shared-model-fix` case
rows, including two pairs of allocator witnesses; it does not identify
seven independent defects. Full historical ladder/reporting runs keep
their original dates and source pins. The initial MUST checkpoint reran row 1
and six named fast differential lanes; the closure also checks multi-TU,
the multi-TU tray, address-space and immaculate lanes, as recorded above.

Remaining work is tracked in [TODO.md](TODO.md). Concurrency prototypes
and the archived reasoning effort are records, not offered product
features. The successor reasoning project is `cerberus-sl`; the older
`refined-cerberus` checkout was retired on 2026-09-16. Source: [USER 2026-09-16]
"cerberus-sl is our main upstream customer at the moment. I retired refined-cerberus (it got too messy)."
([charter record](docs/2026-09-16_charter-allocator-soundness-address-bound.md),
checked 2026-09-24 at `e9f9d049f`; closure F6).


## Reproduce the supported demonstration

The README builds the default **sequential**, concrete-memory LP64 pipeline
and runs `tests/minimal/001-return-literal.c` (return 42). The small gate
set is row 1 (`test_unit.sh`) plus minimal, coverage, debug, float, bytes
and libc lanes; see the README's exact commands. The default observation
projection is `full`; the multi-TU tray uses its documented
`failure-class` projection. Neither an excluded case nor an exhausted run
counts as semantic agreement. The follow-up record records the pins and
actual rerun set; it does not promote the historical Tier B/C campaigns.

For fork defects use [OathTech/cerberus-lean issues](https://github.com/OathTech/cerberus-lean/issues)
with the C source, source/Lem pins, toolchain and command. Upstream drafts
are maintained in the tray; only entries labelled Filed have recorded
submission evidence. Release publication still requires the anonymous fetch
and clean dependency-download checks in the follow-up record (M9).
