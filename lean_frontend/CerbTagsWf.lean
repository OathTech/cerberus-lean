  CerbTagsWf — well-formedness of a tag environment (fuel-parameter arc C4,
  2026-09-05): the HYPOTHESIS vocabulary of the hypothesis-carrying measured
  seams (lem-lean `declare {lean} fuel_measure val f = `μ` assuming `H``,
  doc/lean-backend/2026-09-05_measure-hypothesis-record.md; the C2 record's
  D-C2-1, option 1 [USER 2026-09-05] "agree, go ahead with option 1").

  The layout oracle of CerbMem.lean (sizeof / alignof / offsetsof /
  offsetsofMembers / memberAlign, impl_mem.ml:98-273) and the byte
  deserializer (reconstructValue, impl_mem.ml:916-1095) recurse through TAG
  LOOKUPS: a struct/union type's size is computed from its members' types,
  read from the tag environment. No data measure over the parameters bounds
  that recursion — a cyclic table (`struct A { struct A a; }` written by
  hand into a Core file) makes it non-terminating — so the sufficiency
  obligation of a measured wrapper needs a hypothesis: the environment is
  ACYCLIC in the by-value sense, i.e. the "enters the definition of" relation
  on tags is well-founded (a RANK descends along every by-value reference).

  THE FRONTEND INVARIANT this rests on (the register scripts/fuel_hypotheses.txt
  cites it per row): a C translation unit's tag environment is acyclic by
  construction — frontend/model/cabs_to_ail.lem `check_members`
  (`:1512`, STD §6.7.2.1#3) refuses a struct/union member whose type is a
  function or INCOMPLETE; `AilTypesAux.is_complete` (frontend/model/ail/
  ailTypesAux.lem:222) makes a by-value `Struct sym`/`Union sym` complete only
  when `sym` is ALREADY in `sigm.tag_definitions`, an `Array` complete only when
  its element type is, `Atomic` when its inner type is, and a `Pointer`
  complete regardless of its target; the flexible array member's ELEMENT
  type is guaranteed by the Ail passes (`ailWf.lem:76-80`
  `ArrayDeclarationIncompleteType`/`StructMemberFlexibleArrayInArray`,
  `genTyping.lem:2346-2349` `StructMemberFlexibleArray`: every by-value edge
  INTO a FAM struct is a constraint violation, so that edge cannot close a
  cycle); an `_Alignas(type)` member alignment is completeness-checked by
  `alignof_ty` on the non-agnostic path (`:2851-2871`) — NOT on the
  character-member `Just LT` path (`:2882-2883`, `ailTypesAux.lem:1291-1292`):
  `struct A { _Alignas(struct A) char c; }`, an ISO §6.5.3.4#1 constraint
  violation gcc rejects, is ACCEPTED by the frontend, its table has a by-value
  self-edge, `Acyclic` is FALSE for it, both oracles hang and the Lean wrapper
  fails loudly (`CerbMem.memberAlign: fuel exhausted`) — a frontend GAP
  (C4 pre-merge audit F-A2, upstream-tray candidate), so the guarantee is:
  `Acyclic` holds for every program the frontend ACCEPTS CORRECTLY. Hence at
  the moment a tag's definition is accepted, every tag its members reference
  BY VALUE (through arrays and atomics, never through a pointer or a function
  type) is defined EARLIER: the position in definition order is a rank;
  pointers break the recursion (`struct A { struct B *p; }; struct B { struct
  A a; };` is
  fine). A hand-authored Core file can violate it — which is exactly why the
  hypothesis lives in the obligation, not in the wrapper: on inputs violating
  it the fuel-free wrapper may EXHAUST (the loud sentinel), as the oracle
  itself loops or overflows its stack there.

  Everything here is stated over the LOOKUP the code performs (`lookup`:
  CerbMem's `(fmapElements m).find? (symbolEquality · tag)` — digest+nat,
  description-insensitive; impl_mem.ml's `Pmap.find tag_sym tagDefs`), never
  over the map's internal representation, so no comparator law is needed.
  Ranks are on the looked-up ENTRIES (the stored `Loc × tag_definition`
  values), not on symbols: two symbols that resolve to the same entry share
  its rank by construction.

  MIRROR-OCAML NOTE: a Lean-target reasoning artifact; no OCaml text
  corresponds (fuel is a Lean-target artifact). The predicates are Props
  (they appear only in obligations and in consumers' theorems); the measures
  (`envBound` & co.) are the fuel-free wrappers' arguments and DO execute —
  each is a bound derived in CerbMem_lemMeasureProofs.lean from the code's
  hop structure (the `+ 2`/`+ 3` are hop counts, not budgets).

/-! ## The measures (execute: the fuel-free wrappers' fuel arguments)

    Every by-value hop of the layout recursion enters an entry of the
    environment at most once along any path (the rank strictly descends), and
    between two hops descends structurally inside one entry's member types.
    So a sufficient fuel is: the structural size of the type asked about, plus
    for every entry of the environment its members' total structural size and
    the constant number of fuel decrements one hop costs. The proof
    (CerbMem_lemMeasureProofs.lean, `pot`/`W`) derives the constants from
    the code: `+ 2` per entry (sizeof → offsetsof → offsetsofMembers →
    sizeof/memberAlign → alignof is the longest hop, whose frames beyond the
    structural ones are two), `+ 1`/`+ 2`/`+ 3` per wrapper for its own
    frames. No budget, no magic value: each term is a derived size or a hop
    count. -/

    every type it makes the recursion enter. -/
